### Project Overview

This project is a simple user authentication system that allows users to register and log in using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication. It is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB for storing user data.

#### Key Components

1. **Express Server**:
   - The backend server is set up using Express, a popular Node.js web application framework. It handles incoming HTTP requests and responses.

2. **MongoDB Database**:
   - MongoDB is used as the database to store user information. It is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents.

3. **User Registration**:
   - Users can create an account by providing a username and password.
   - The server checks if the username already exists. If it does not, the password is hashed (encrypted) and stored in the database along with the username.
   - If registration is successful, the server responds with a success message.

4. **User Login**:
   - Users can log in by providing their username and password.
   - The server verifies the username and checks if the provided password matches the stored hashed password.
   - Upon successful authentication, the server generates a JWT. This token is a secure string that encodes the userâ€™s identity and is used to verify their authenticity in subsequent requests.

5. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**:
   - JWTs are used to manage user sessions and maintain secure communication between the client and server.
   - When a user logs in successfully, a JWT is generated and sent back to the client. This token must be included in the headers of future requests to access protected resources or endpoints.

6. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**:
   - CORS is configured to allow requests from different origins (e.g., a frontend application running on a different port) to interact with the backend server.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - The server includes error handling to manage issues such as invalid credentials or server errors. Appropriate error messages are returned to the client to inform them of what went wrong.

#### Flow of Operations

1. **Registration**:
   - The client sends a POST request to the server with a username and password.
   - The server checks if the username is already taken. If not, it hashes the password and stores the new user in the database.
   - The server responds with a confirmation message.

2. **Login**:
   - The client sends a POST request with the username and password.
   - The server verifies the credentials. If correct, it generates a JWT and sends it back to the client.
   - The client uses this JWT for subsequent requests to access protected routes.

### Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using a cryptographic algorithm before storing them in the database. This adds a layer of security by protecting password data.
- **JWT Expiry**: JWTs typically have an expiration time to limit their validity and reduce the risk of misuse if a token is compromised.
